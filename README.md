# Docker

- Docker is Open-source containerization platform to create, deploy and run application.

- Docker is written in GO language.

- Docker uses containers on host OS to run applications. It allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual OS.

- We can install Docker on any OS but Docker engines runs only on Linux distribution.

- Docker performs OS level virtualisation also called as containerisation.

- Docker packages software into standard units called as Container that have everything that need to run application, including code, run time, system tools, libraries and dependencies.

- Before docker many user face problems that a particular code is running in the developer system but not in the user system.

- It was initially released in march 2013 and developed by Solomon-Hykes and Sebastian Pahl.

- Docker is set of Platform as a service that use OS level virtualisation, whereas VM ware uses hard-ware level virtualisation.

- The Main advantage of docker methodologies is shipping, testing and deploying code quickly. so, we can eliminate the differences between development and production environments.

- Using docker we will create image for our application.

- Docker images we can share easily to multiple machines

- Using Docker image, we can create docker container and we can run multiple containers using single image.
