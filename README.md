# Docker

- Docker is Open-source containerization platform to create, deploy and run application.

- Docker is written in GO language.

- Docker uses containers on host OS to run applications. It allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual OS.

- We can install Docker on any OS but Docker engines runs only on Linux distribution.

- Docker performs OS level virtualisation also called as containerisation.

- Docker packages software into standard units called as Container that have everything that need to run application, including code, run time, system tools, libraries and dependencies.

- Before docker many user face problems that a particular code is running in the developer system but not in the user system.

- It was initially released in march 2013 and developed by Solomon-Hykes and Sebastian Pahl.

- Docker is set of Platform as a service that use OS level virtualisation, whereas VM ware uses hard-ware level virtualisation.

- The Main advantage of docker methodologies is shipping, testing and deploying code quickly. so, we can eliminate the differences between development and production environments.

- Using docker we will create image for our application.

- Docker images we can share easily to multiple machines

- Using Docker image, we can create docker container and we can run multiple containers using single image.

# Why Docker 

- Let’s assume that we are developing a software project.

- The Collection of programs is called as software project and every Software project contains several components.

	1. Front end components (User interface logic)
		- Angular, React, HTML & CSS, J Query

	2. Backend components (Business logic)
		- Java 1.8v, Spring boot

	3. Database (Persistence login)
		- MySQL DB, Mango DB

- To develop the application, we need to install those dependencies to run our code.

- In order to deploy our application in a machine, we need to setup all the Software. which are required to run our application.

	- Ex: OS, Java 11v, MySQL DB, Tomcat Webserver 9.0v etc..

- In real time, Project should be deployed into multiple env for testing purpose.

    - Ex: DEV, SIT, UAT, PILOT and PROD 

        - Dev env will be used by developers to perform integration testing.

        - SIT (System Integration Testing) env will be used by testing team to test functionality of the application.

        - UAT (User Acceptance Testing) env will be used by Client to test functionality of the application.

        - PILOT env means pre-production testing env.

        - PROD env means live env where public can access the application. (It is used to deliver the project)

- After some time, i need another version of java, react and mango DB for my application to run the code.

- So, its difficult situation to maintain multiple versions of same tool in our system.

### `To overcome this problem, we use Virtualisation`

## Virtualisation | Virtualisation - Architecure :

- Installing multiple Guest OS in one Host OS is called Virtualisation.

- Using Hypervisor, we will create multiple virtual machines in our machine

- In that Virtual Machine, we can host Guest OS in our Machine

- By using Guest OS, we can run multiple Application in same machine.

- It is old technique to run the application.

- System performance will become slow in this process.

### Advantages:

- Multiple OS in same machine.

- Easy Maintenance & Recovery 

- Lower total cost of Ownership

### Dis-Advantages:

- It is old method to run the application.

- If we use multiple VM then the performance of the system is low.

- Long boot-up process (Approx 1 min)

### `To over-come this virtualisation, we use Containerization Concept`

## Containerisation | Containerisation - Architecure :

- Instead of installing multiple VM on host OS. we will use Containerisation.

- Containerisation used to pack the application along with dependencies in one container to run application is called Containerization.

- Container is nothing but it is a virtual machine which does not have any OS. 

- Instead of OS, we will use images to create multiple container.

- Docker engine is used to create multiple containers in same machine.

- Container will take care of everything. which is required to run our application.

- Containers are lightweight and We can run multiple containers at a time.

### Advantages Over Virtualisation:

- Containers on same OS kernel are lighter & smaller 

- Better resource utilisation compared to VM 

- Short Boot-up process (1/20th of a second)

### Conclusion 

- Docker is Containerization Software
 	
- Docker will take care of application and application dependencies to run application.

- Deployments into multiple environments will become easy if we use docker containers concept.
